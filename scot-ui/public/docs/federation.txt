Federation cases

site scot (Sscot) to COE scot (Cscot) communication can be logically two way:

Cscot to Sscot
    #1: stuff created in Cscot pushed to a site scot

Sscot to Cscot
    #2: stuff created in site gets push to Cscot
    #3: Sscot can query Cscot for data

BUT, there may be a case where Cscot can not access via web the Sscot 
due to firewall/policy.  So we need to be able to have the Sscot poll
Cscot for changes since last poll to catch #1 above.  So logically,
it becomes a version ov case #3.

The polling solution has the advantage of Cscot needing credentials on
the remote scot.
