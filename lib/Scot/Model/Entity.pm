);

=item B<status>

some entities are very noisey and you probably will want to 
avoid tracking them, for example your top level domain name
valid statuses = tracked | untracked

=cut

has status  => (
    is          => 'ro',
    isa         => 'Str',
    required    => 1,
    default     => 'tracked',
);

=item B<data>

hold data in a key value store about the entity.
not sure what this will be but it is a safety valve 

=cut

has data    => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'HashRef',
    traits  => [ 'Hash' ],
    required    => 1,
    default => sub {{}},
);
