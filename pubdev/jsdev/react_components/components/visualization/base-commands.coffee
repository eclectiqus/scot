        Take the input and apply the function directly to it,
        regardless of its internal format. Normally, data is checked
        to see if it is list-like or not before deciding what the
        behavior of map and fold, etc should be. In this case, you're
        saying that you just want whatever the contents of the data is
        to be handed to you directly in one piece.
        
        Example:
           $ [1,2,3] \\ into (f) -> 12

        uniq takes an optional comparison function and returns the
        input list with all duplicate entries removed. This works like
        the unix uniq command, which means you *have* to give it
        sorted data. You can use the same comparison function for uniq
        that you use for sort (and the default function will work in
        almost all cases, which means you can usually just skip this
        parameter entirely). If you need to wrote a comparison
        function, it should return zero if the two items are equal.

        Uniq only compares adjacent items in the list. If your list is
        not sorted so that the duplicate items are all next to each
        other, it will not work.

        Examples:
            $ [1,2,2,3,3,3,4] \\ uniq

        nest works like group, except that your function should return

        data set will be placed into an object hierarchy so that its
        key list will locate it uniqely. This is useful for making
        tree structures.

        Example:
            $ [1,2,3,4,5] \\ nest (n) -> [

        tabulate [basevalue]

        tabulate fills out a 2d table from a sparse representation of
        the table. Assuming you have an object, which has a number of
        keys whose associated values are also objects, tabulate will
        iterate through all keys and subkeys to collect all of the row
        identifiers and column identifiers. It will then generate a
        table that includes *all* rows and columns from all data
        elements, with the elements themselves populated at the
        appropriate positions. An example of using this might be to
        transform an association list representation of a network into
        a full association matrix. For example, if you have data that
        tells you when messages have passed between various hosts on a
        network, use the pipe system to work that data into an object
        with a key for each entity that has sent a message, and a
        value that's an object with a key for each entity that the
        sender has sent *to*. Then, pipe that data into tabulate, and
        it will generate a full table for you so that you can render
        it or further manipulate it in a normalized way.

        basevalue is optional, and allows you to either generate a
        list-structured table or an object-structured table. It
        defaults to object-structured.

        Example (association matrix of communicating hosts):
            $ get "http://somewhere.com/messages.json" \\
            .. group (msg)->msg.sender \\
            .. mapkeys (sender, receivers) -> List.group receivers, (msg)->msg.receiver \\
            .. tabulate

        The example will fetch a list of messages from some server,
        then group them by sender (this returns an object with a key
        for each unique sender, and a list of all messages that sender
        sent). It then iterates over the senders in that object to
        further group the messages by receiver. The object now has the
        structure obj[sender][receiver] = [list of messages]. This is
        passed to tabulate, which generates a full 2d table and puts
        the message lists in the appropriate row and column. At this
        point you could easily generate a heatmap from the data to
        show which hosts are talking most frequently, or do some other
        processing to it that takes advantage of the full table
        structure.

        intersect [proc]

        intersect finds all of the elements in common between all
        items in a list of lists or objects. It treats the input as a
        set of sets and computes the intersection of all of them. The
        proc argument is optional, and can be used to specify how to
        decide which items are equal by providing a name based on the
        item. For example, if you have a set of lists of groups of
        numbers, you could specify proc to just sum the numbers in a
        group. The intersection would then be calculated based on that
        sum as the identifying property of each group.

        The result returned is an object that has keys for each
        identified item (result of calling proc), and a list of the
        items from each set that matched.

        If you have multiple items within a single set that map to the
        same identifier, you will get unexpected results. The
        colliding items will count separately toward the intersection
        goal, so you may get extra elements in the corresponding list,
        or you may get some elements that don't appear in all sets.

        Example:
            $ [[[1..3],[6],[2,3]],[[2,4],[5]],[[6],[5],[2,3,4]]] \\

            }
                    
        In the example, note that the group that sums to 6 has four
        items even though there are only three sets involved. This
